Michael C. Whitlock was key into the development of SimBit via his participation in many discussions of algorithmic and user interface design. Pirmin Nietlisbach is the main beta tester.


## Getting Started

Download the most recent release! The folder will contain a user manual, have a look at it and enjoy!


### Compilation

SimBit is written in C++ and requires the standard of C++14 to be compiled. SimBit uses several of the standard libraries as well as a few boost libraries.

`cd` to the downloaded folder and type `make` to call the makeFile for compilation. The makefile is very simple but should be sufficient. The compilation can take a few minutes.


## Running a test

By calling the executable only, SimBit will list the possible options and abort. Just do

`bin/SimBit` 

For a simple example of simulation, you can use `exampleCommand.txt` by doing

`bin/SimBit file exampleCommand.txt 1`

Please read the manual.pdf for more information.
