CHANGES

SimBit_1.1
	Fix a bug with recombinations. The vector of positions is sorted and duplicates are removed.
	Security check that files correctly opened.

SimBit_1.6
	Plenty of small fix and bugs and improvements

SimBit_1.7
	Uses of two populations which are never deleted -> Big improvement in speed.

SimBit_1.8
	Split BREEDING_SELECTION_DISPERSAL into smaller functions as ot make profiling easier.

SimBit_1.14
	Keep improving things. Big add in how arguments can be specified.

SimBit_2.0
	Add new type of trait and change nomenclature quite a bit.

SimBit_2.5
	Recombination is much improved. Also, along the way between SimBit_2.0 and SimBit_2.5 I saved fitnesses per chromosome and allow to use them if the user specify (s)he wants to use multiplicity type of dominance for trait 1 (just like trait 2 does).

SimBit_2.10
	Fix aweful to find bug.

SimBit_2.17
	LocalEffects is site specific
	temporal arguments
	Performance improvement

SimBit_2.18
	Merge LocalEffect with FitnessEffect. Add flag --Habitat

SimBit_2.23
	Fitness are now attributes of Chromosome and not of Individual
	Fix bug. I forgot to set fitness back to -1.0 when changing habitat.

SimBit_2.25
	Can read arguments from file as well as from the command line
	class Chromosome has been renamed Haplotype

SimBit_2.27
	MultiThreading

SimBit_3.0
	Give up on trying to have a vector of fitness values for each individuals to avoid recalculation. I got back to an old code and just have a single fitness value per haplotype.

SimBit_3.3
	Just a renaming. TIMBIT stands for Tracking Individual Markers with BITs

SimBit_3.5
	Fixed an important bug in the recombination process. Copt_into_T1 was making a shift of 8 bits causing mutations to propagate to nearby loci!

SimBit_3.5
	class SimulationTracker build to speed up 'writeoutput_T1_vcf'.
	Get rid of 'vcfNeutralOnly'

SimBit_3.8
	Fixed a compilation issue by overloading operator== in TrackedT1Mutation
	Tried (but failed) to remove the need of boost by using STL instead

SimBit_3.10
	When outputting the VCF file, the first element of the header was 'Chrom' instead of 'CHROM'. Also, information line should start with a double #. Fixed now.

SimBit_3.11
	Allows to specify specific T1 sequence we want vcf output for.

SimBit_3.12
	Uses more std::string and fewer char* to make future changes easier to deal with.
	Indicate the name of the log file on the console right above the generation

SimBit_3.13
	Changes in the design of the standard output

SimBit_3.14
	Get rid of the need of boost

SimBit_3.15
	Security to make sure that SimTracker does not end up taking up too much RAM and made generation a global variable

SimBit_3.16
	Fixed a tiny bug in the production of vcf files
	Allow ProgrammedMutations
	CurrentGeneration is now part of Parameters and is therefore global.
	
SimBit_3.17
	When there was no variation in mutation_rate, then the mutation_rate simulated was too high. The bug is fixed now.
