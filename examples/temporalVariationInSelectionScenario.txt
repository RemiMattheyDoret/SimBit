##### This is a very simple input file
##### Because this input file spend over several lines, it will need to be called with 'bin/SimBit f examples/basicSimulation.txt all'
##### The simulation runs in 8 seconds on my personal laptop


### Set number of generations
--nbGens 1e4

### Set number of patch.
### Could be called '--PN 4'
--PatchNumber 4

### All patches contain 100 individuals.
--N unif 100

### Set genetic map of 1000 T5 loci. '--L T5 100 T5 900' would be perfeclty equivalent.
--L T1 1e3 

### Mutation rate for T1 loci.
### All loci have a mutation rate of 0.0001
--T1_mu unif 1e-4

### Migration scenario
--m island 0.05

### Recombination rate: Distance of 1e-6 cM between any two loci.
### Note that if you want to specify the recombination between any two loci, use the keyword 'A' instead of 'unif' and specify one fewer values than there are loci indicated with the --L option.
--r cM unif 1e-6

### Associate patches to habitats
### Patches 0, 1 and 2 are set to habitat zero throughout the whole simulation. Patch 3 is set to habitat 0 for the first 1000 generations and then to habitat 1 until generation 500 and finally to habitat 2 until the end of the simulation
--H @G0 unif 0 @G50 A 0 0 0 1 @G5e3 A 0 0 0 2


### Selection
### First habitat: No selection
### Second habitat: Mild selection
### Third habitat: Mild selection on first 800 loci and then strong selection on the last 200 loci
--T1_fit @H0 multfitUnif 1 @H1 multfitUnif 0.99 @H2 multfitA rep 0.99 800 rep 0.9 200


### No outputs has been required. SimBit should send a warning message
