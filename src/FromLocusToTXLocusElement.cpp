Note for Remi of things to do:
    Test how much slower it is to have N=1e5, L=10 vs N=10, L=1e5 to estimate the cost of having Individuals not contiguous in memory

    When using several environment, fitnessMap should take migration rate into account. This migration rate can vary through time and therefore fitnessMap should be redefined for faster simulations
